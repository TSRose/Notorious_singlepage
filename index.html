                            Notorious is a full-sized recreation of a 15th Century caravel - the first style of ship to leave Europe to explore Africa, Asia, the America's and beyond. First attributed to Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, and quickly adopted by the Spanish.
                            Her specs: 56ft, 60,000kgs. Constructed entirely from reclaimed timber, mainly unwanted 100+ year old Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) rescued from bonfires on farms in Western Victoria, not a single tree was felled to
                            build her.

                            historical Portuguese and Spanish vessels, nautical architecture and drawing plans.

                            The original idea and design of the caravel is somewhat shouded in the mists of history, but historians usually attribut its invention to Prince Henry the Navigator (or Infante D. Henrique of Portugal, Duke of Viseu) caravels were the ships which heralded
                            the beginning of the 'Age of Discovery'. Sent out from Portugal and Spain to explore and map new lands, these ships travelled to unknown-to-Europeans parts of the world, sometimes for years, sometimes not returning at all.
                            When they did return, they brought with them something more valuable than gold - information. The first forays of caravels were out in to the Atlantic Ocean from the Algarve Coast of Portugal. These voyages mapped the West
                            African coast, and the Portuguese returned with people brutally stolen from these lands and forced in to servitude. The first Slave Market in Europe was established in the port city of Lagos, Portugal.
